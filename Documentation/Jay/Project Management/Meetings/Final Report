Final report
------------
As of the 13th of may we have a very good model that can run on a accuracy of 85% on the training data, and around 80% on the testing data.
This model the one available on is the one avilable on google drive. (Link in the home ReadME.)

At the time of writing this report owen has handed in his GUI mission sheet. with Mark handing in both project ideation and baseline implementation.
I have handed in all of my work and have written up the hand in confimation. I will be handing this in at the end of the day. (00:00 digital time because analouge gcan get confusing.)

This project is handed in and i have checked it is working. I have asked my team to check aswell just incase it's only my machine, however no responce. So i assume it works.
