Bounding box car detection with Keras
========

This project will detect cars with bounding boxes, all done with keras and tensorflow libraries.

To get it up and running:

1. clone the repo
2. open baseline implementation. 
3. Create a new conda environment from the environment(.yml file) file within the repo.
4. Run the model and see first results.

The baseline implementation is the first file to get the code working. Not the most recent and most
accurate model. Therefore, for better results. Please use the other .py files. 

Features
--------

- Car detection with bounding boxes
- Using keras to create and train cnns
- A gui has been created

Installation
------------
Create conda environment from our .yml file:

    conda env create -f <filename>.yml

The first line of the .yml file sets the new environment's name.

Activate the new environment:

    conda activate <name>

Check the environment has been created successfully:

    conda env list

The new environment should appear in this list.

**Make sure to select this environment in your editor.**

Execution
---------

Should you wish to create your own model using either car train or car train aug. First open the command console. Next navigate to the folder that the .py files are stored.

Support
-------

If you are having issues, please check the environment has been set up and all dependencies have been covered. Otherwise, email us.
